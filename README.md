### Project Description
This project is a "Test Score Calculator" program that is created in LC-3 assembly programming, using an LC-3 Simulator through the editor and the simulator.

### Design Specifications
The "Test Score Calculator" meets the following criteria:
1. Appropriate addresses: origination, fill, array, input and output
2. Display minimum, maximum, average values and grades in console
3. Appropriate labels and comments
4. Appropriate instructions for arithmetic, data movement and conditional operations
5. Comprise of 2 or more subroutines and implement subroutine calls
6. Use branching for control: conditional and iterative
7. Manage overflow and storage allocation
8. Manage stack: include PUSH-POP operation on stack
9. Include save-restore operations
10. Include pointer
11. Implement ASCII conversion operations
12. Use appropriate system call directives
13. Testing - test the program using the values: 52, 87, 96, 79, 61

### Purpose of the Program
To create an LC-3 program that will display the maximum, minimum, average score and the letter grade equivelance (0-50=F, 60-69=D, 70-79=C, 80-89=B, 90-100=A).

### Program Usage Instructions
  1. Load the program into the LC-3 Simulator
  2. Run the program
  3. Follow the prompt on screen to enter 5 test scores via the keyboard. User can submit an empty line at any point in this step to receive a prompt to terminate the program early
  4. After entering the 5th valid score, the program will output the lowest score, highest score, average score, and letter grade equivalents to the entered scores
  5. User will be prompted to run the program with 5 new scores or terminate the session
  6. Terminate the program or return to step three, depending on answer to the prompt in step 5
